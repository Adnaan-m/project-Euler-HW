# project-Euler-HW

### Description
The following ReadMe displays the information regarding the code used to solve several tasks presented from the Project Euler website. [Click Here](https://projecteuler.net) to see the website.

### Languages used
* Ruby

### How to download
1. Search for Adnaan-m in GitHub. [Click Here](https://github.com/Adnaan-m/project-Euler-HW) for the link.
2. Search for the project-Euler-HW repository.
3. Download the files displayed.

### Challenges
* Simplifying the code for the second task. In reality, a for loop would have been implemented to check the lowest integar that that first 20 numerical numbers would go into. However, the system was not able to respond to the for loop within another for loop. The initial idea was like the following, but did not work.

```rb
for j in 2500000..300000000
  for i in 1..20
  if j % i == 0
    p j
  end
end
```
### Learning points
1. Programming languages are very similar in the sense of coding but differ syntactically.
2. Embedded FOR loops are amazing ( ! )
